1. Find the index of a specific element in an array, if the element is not present, print -1. Ask the size of the array from the user and then implement it.
2. Create an array of char types and store ‘a’ to ‘z’ in it. Then print the element of the arrays.
3. Find the second largest element in an array of unique elements of size n. Where n>3.
4. Find the third smallest element in an array of unique elements size n. Where n>3.
5.Given an unsorted array arr[] of size n having both negative and positive integers. The task is place all negative element at the end of array without changing the order of positive element and negative element.

Example 1:

Input : 
n = 8
arr[] = {1, -1, 3, 2, -7, -5, 11, 6 }
Output : 
1  3  2  11  6  -1  -7  -5

7. Reverse the array
Example :-  Input:- [1,2,3,4,5]
            Output:- [5,4,3,2,1]

8. Given an array Arr of size N, print the second largest distinct element from an array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the 
array is 35 and the second largest element
is 34.


9. Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4


10. Cyclically rotate an array by one

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
5 1 2 3 4

11. Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7, X = 2
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 4
Explanation: 2 occurs 4 times in the
given array.
