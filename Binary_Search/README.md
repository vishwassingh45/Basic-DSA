1. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
    
    Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]


2. Search Insert Position
    
    Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

    You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 
 
 Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4


3. Sqrt(x)


   Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.


Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
