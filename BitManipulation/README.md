# BIT MANIPULATION


```Text

1. Write a code to combine three digits

   example:- Input:- int a=2,b=3,c=5
             Output:- 235

2. Convert Decimal to Binary.
   
   example:- Input:- 35
             output:-10001
             
3. Convert Binary to Decimal
       
       example:- Input:- 1101
                 Output:- 13
             
4. Convert Decimal to Octal
      
      example:- Input:- 35
                Output:-43
                
5. Convert Octal to Decimal
      
      example:- Input:- 43
                Ouput:- 35
                
6.  Convert Binary to Octal
       example:- Input:- 1111
                 Output:- 17
                 
7.  Convert Octal to Binary
       example:- Input:- 17
                 output:-1111


8. Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.
    
     example:-  Input: num = 38
                Output: 2
            
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it

9. For an input year N, find whether the year is a leap or not. 
  
     example :- Input: N = 4
                Output: 1
Explanation:
4 is not divisible by 100
and is divisible by 4 so its
a leap year
