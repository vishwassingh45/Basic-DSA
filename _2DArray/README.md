1. Addition of Two matrix.

2. Row wise Maximum sum 

Example:- Matrix -> [3,4,7,6] = 20 
                    [2,8,3,9] = 22 
                    [5,4,2,2] = 13
                    [7,3,0,8] = 18
                    [2,8,9,4] = 23
                    
Output:- 23


3. Diagonal Sum
Note :- It is only applicable with same number of row and column.
 Example :- Matrix -> [ 1 1 1 ]
                      [ 1 1 1 ]
                      [ 1 1 1 ]
                      
  Output :- 2,2
